# wshta
Miscellaneous Scripts for Windows, most of which are for WSH (WScript or cscript,) HTA (mshta) and other applications using the same script engines, even IE, or MS Office.

The JavaScript in here is the JScript flavor.

There is also VBScript, and may be PowerShell, Batch, etc,

## History
I've been using these and their predecessors on a LAN for a long time and thought why not share them publicly?
They were originally planned to be released in [a general scripts collection](//github.com/Quasic/scripts), but thought that was too bulky.
